      "\n",
      "1. **You give the computer data**: This can be pictures, words, numbers, or any other type of information.\n",
      "2. **The computer looks for patterns**: It tries to find relationships between the data, like \"when it's sunny, people wear shorts\".\n",
      "3. **The computer makes predictions**: Based on the patterns it found, the computer makes predictions about new, unseen data.\n",
      "4. **The computer learns from its mistakes**: When the computer makes a mistake, it uses that information to improve its predictions next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:** Imagine you want to teach a computer to recognize pictures of dogs and cats. You show it many pictures of dogs and cats, and it looks for patterns in the data. After a while, it can look at a new picture and say \"oh, that's a dog!\" or \"that's a cat!\".\n",

      "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model that have revolutionized the field of computer vision.

      "3. **Pooling Layers**: These layers downsample the feature maps, reducing the spatial dimensions while retaining the most important information.\n",
      "4. **Flattening Layers**: The output of the convolutional and pooling layers is flattened into a 1D array, preparing the data for the fully connected layers.\n",
      "5. **Fully Connected Layers**: These layers are used for classification, where the flattened output is fed into a neural network to produce a probability distribution over the classes.\n",
