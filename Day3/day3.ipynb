They're so dense, they warp space-time around them, creating a gravitational pull that's like a cosmic vacuum cleaner. Anything that gets too close, including light, gets sucked in and never comes out. Talk about a buzzkill!\n",

And who knows, maybe one day we'll figure out how to harness their power and create a universe-sized game of cosmic pool.\n",

      "\n",
      "Imagine you're playing with a ball on the playground. You throw the ball up in the air, and what happens? It comes back down, right? That's because the Earth is pulling on the ball with an invisible force called gravity. The Earth is like a big magnet, and it's pulling everything towards it, including you!\n",
      "\n",
      "But why does the Earth do this? Well, it's because the Earth is a massive object with a lot of mass (that's a fancy word for \"stuff\"). And anything that has mass, including you and me, has its own gravity. But the Earth's mass is so much bigger than ours that its gravity is much stronger. That's why we don't float off into space when we're standing on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gravity is also what keeps us on the ground when we're walking or running. It's like the Earth is giving us a big hug, and we're stuck to it. That's why we don't fall off the Earth when we're moving around. We're always being pulled towards the center of the planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gravity is also responsible for the tides. You know how the ocean water seems to come in and out of the shore? That's because the Earth's gravity is pulling on the water, making it bulge out in certain areas. It's like the Earth is giving the ocean a big hug, and the water is squishing out in response.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "            val = int(board[i][j])\n",
      "            idx = (i // 3) * 3 + j // 3\n",

      "            boxes[idx].add(val)\n",
      "\n",
      "    return True\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of the code:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. We initialize three lists of sets: `rows`, `cols`, and `boxes`. Each set will store the digits encountered in each row, column, and 3x3 sub-box, respectively.\n",
      "2. We iterate through the Sudoku board, checking each cell. If the cell is empty (represented by \". \"), we skip it.\n",
      "3. For each non-empty cell, we extract the digit `val` and calculate the index `idx` of the corresponding 3x3 sub-box.\n",
      "4. We check if `val` is already present in the current row, column, or sub-box. If it is, we return `False`, indicating that the Sudoku board is invalid.\n",
      "5. If `val` is not present in any of the sets, we add it to the corresponding sets for the row, column, and sub-box.\n",
      "6. Finally, if we reach the end of the loop without returning `False`, we return `True`, indicating that the Sudoku board is valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "This solution has a time complexity of O(1) since we only iterate through the board once, and a space complexity of O(1) since we only use a fixed amount of memory to store the sets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feel free to test the function with your example inputs or create your own Sudoku boards to validate!\n",
      "******************************\n",
      "This code is a solution to the Sudoku validation problem in Python. The Sudoku board is represented as a 9x9 2D list, where each cell can be either a digit from 1 to 9, or a dot (\".\") to represent an empty cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The function `isValidSudoku` takes a Sudoku board as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the board is valid or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The code initializes three lists of sets: `rows`, `cols`, and `boxes`. These sets are used to keep track of the digits that have been encountered in each row, column, and 3x3 sub-box, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The code then iterates through each cell in the Sudoku board. For each cell, it checks if the cell is empty (represented by \".\").\n",
      "\n",
      "4. If the cell is not empty, the code extracts the digit `val` from the cell and calculates the index `idx` of the corresponding 3x3 sub-box.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The code then checks if `val` is already present in the current row, column, or sub-box. If it is, the function returns `False` to indicate that the Sudoku board is invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. If `val` is not present in any of the sets, the code adds it to the corresponding sets for the row, column, and sub-box.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. If the function completes the iteration without returning `False`, it returns `True` to indicate that the Sudoku board is valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because it only iterates through the board once, and the space complexity is also O(1) because it only uses a fixed amount of memory to store the sets.\n",
      "\n",
      "This solution is efficient because it only checks each digit once in each row, column, and sub-box. It does not need to check each digit multiple times, which would increase the time complexity.\n"
